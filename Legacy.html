The Midway Monument of the Naval Academy stands as a reminder of the epic battle. The current American Naval presence in East Asia can also be attributed to the legacy of Midway, which not only shortened the duration of the Pacific War but changed the outcome of many in the region. Likewise, Wade McClusky's legacy stands out today, with his name living on in both the USS McClusky and the Wade McClusky Award, which celebrates the most outstanding squadron in the Navy.</p>

McClusky's career in the Navy showed his unwavering commitment to service, incredible heroism in battle, and extreme modesty. A fine example of the Naval Academy and US Navy, McClusky's untold decision in the Pacific stands as an example of selfless leadership and its enduring impact on history.</p>
