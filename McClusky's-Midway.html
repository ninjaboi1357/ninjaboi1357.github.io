        <div class="row-1"><p>On the morning of June 4th, 1942, VF-6 entered battle. Only half an hour prior, Midway base was subject to a major aerial bombardment spearheaded by the Japanese carriers. In accordance with the American counterattack plan, the squadron leader, Wade McClusky, was instructed to search northwest of Midway and attack any enemy ship found. However, no vessels were present when McClusky arrived at the designated point. Faced with the decision to search further or retreat, he followed his intuition and experience. Ordering an extended search, McClusky risked running out of fuel and a possible court martial to find the surface force.

        <div class="row-1"><p>On the last leg of the renewed search, McClusky discovered a Japanese ship; tailing it, he discovered his target- the Japanese carriers. Without hesitation, McClusky directed an attack on the carriers. Braving heavy anti-aircraft fire and enemy fighters, McClusky's decision paid off, with VF-6 successfully landing hits on the Kaga and Akagi, incapacitating half the Japanese carrier force. Further attacks on the Japanese fleet left three out of four carriers inoperable. Due in part to a series of poor Japanese strategic decisions, six hours after McClusky's attack, the Japanese Navy's most vital assets were decimated, crushing any Japanese hopes of forcing negotiations with the US. McClusky had tipped the balance of the Pacific Theater in just 240 seconds.
